Self Ripple POC and Ananse Gateway


Self will use its ability to biometrically tie facts (in this case XRPL account key ownership) to individuals to allow consumers and businesses to tie real people and businesses on the Ripple network to their addresses.

Self keys are signed using Self's inbuilt PKI. XRPL account keys as facts in the Self PDS can be signed, requested and transferred as with any other facts on the Self network.
